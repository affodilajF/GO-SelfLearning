# SLICE

- Kinda dynamic version of array (ukurannya bs berubah)
- Slice and Array ALWAYS CONNECTED? what?

- Slice is just to refer data's memorry stored in array.
- Means if theres an slice so theres an array too. 

- The array itself can be explicity written, and the slice referring by [start, stop, step] keyword.
- The aray can be inexplicity written by programmer, it done by the system, the state is achieved by directly writing the slice variable
